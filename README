DESCRIPTION: A small testing API for my c projects.

SUPPORTS: Some comparison functions and a limited range
of support if a test fails.

STYLE: Inspired by Go's syntax for "private" and "public" 
functions, I'll use upper case character in the first letter
of a function if it's decleared "public", and lower case 
if it's decleared "private" (static). 

As a result all functions meant to be available to the 
client will start with an upper case letter. The same
is truth for structs etc. 

TODO: add better feedback and make more tests.

Inspired by Alexander Teinum's Lime.
